This directory contains examples of how to use unishark data driven tests
and configuration files. The tests include examples of assertions and
failing tests.

Use run_tests.py to run a defined set of tests across several classes
or run any of the individual test_module*.py classes. Note that some
tests in test_module2.py are expected to fail.
